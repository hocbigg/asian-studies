# Summary

The Asian Studies curriculum is a complete education in Asian Studies using online materials. The program emphasizes interdisciplinary approaches, balancing history, culture, religion, philosophy, politics, and language proficiency.

Asian Studies is inherently broad, covering East Asia (China, Japan, Korea), South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc.), and Southeast Asia. Students should select a primary regional focus early (e.g., East Asia) while maintaining comparative exposure.

Language study runs parallel throughout, aiming for intermediate proficiency in one Asian language (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, or another relevant to the chosen region).

## Organization

This repository is organized into 2 main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These five sections form the essential backbone of the discipline. Study them in this exact order:

I. Pan-Asian Foundations: Start here. This section gives the basic geographical, historical, religious, and linguistic context shared across much of Asia.

II. Core Regional Histories: Next, learn the major historical development of the three main sub-regions of Asia (East, South, and Southeast). This is the historical spine of the field.

III. Asian Philosophical Traditions: After history, study the major ways of thinking and belief systems that have shaped Asian societies for centuries.

IV. Asian Literatures & Arts: Then explore how Asian cultures have expressed ideas, values, and experiences through literature, visual art, and performance.

V. Modern Asia: Society, Politics, Economy: Finish the core by understanding how Asia changed in the last two centuries – colonialism, independence, modern states, and economic transformation.
