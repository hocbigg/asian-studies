# Summary

The Asian Studies curriculum is a **complete education in Asian Studies** using online materials. The program emphasizes interdisciplinary approaches, balancing history, culture, religion, philosophy, politics, and language proficiency.

Asian Studies is inherently broad, covering East Asia (China, Japan, Korea), South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc.), and Southeast Asia. Students should select a primary regional focus early (e.g., East Asia) while maintaining comparative exposure.

Language study runs parallel throughout, aiming for intermediate proficiency in one Asian language (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, or another relevant to the chosen region).

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
