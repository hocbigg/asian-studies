- [Advanced Regional Specialization](#advanced-regional-specialization)
  - [East Asia](#east-asia)
  - [South Asia](#south-asia)
  - [Southeast Asia](#southeast-asia)

After finishing the five Core sections, you have two main choices:

VI. Advanced Regional Specialization

Pick one (or at most two) of the three sub-regions:

- East Asia
- South Asia
- Southeast Asia

Go deeper into the region that interests you most. This track builds directly on section II and lets you develop stronger expertise in one major cultural-historical area.

VII. Advanced Language & Texts

Choose this track if you want to move toward reading primary sources and engaging with contemporary Asian societies in their own languages.

You can pursue this track alone or combine it with a regional specialization (especially useful if you want to read original historical or literary texts from your chosen region).
